# --- Day 9: Mirage Maintenance ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in JavaScript, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

I managed to code a solution fairly fast (fast for a 6am woken-up brain). Just a lot of array navigation and iterations.

To run the solution, you'll need a javascript interpreter. I used Node.js v21.2.0

```zsh
node day09.js puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```zsh
Part one:
Sum of last steps: 114
The function "answerPartOne" took 2ms to run

Part two:
Sum of previous steps: 2
The function "answerPartTwo" took 0ms to run
```
