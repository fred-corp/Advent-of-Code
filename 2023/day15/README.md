# --- Day 15: Lens Library ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in JavaScript, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you'll need a javascript interpreter. I used Node.js v21.2.0

```zsh
node day15.js puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```zsh
Part one:
1320
The function "answerPartOne" took 0ms to run

Part two:
145
The function "answerPartTwo" took 0ms to run
```
