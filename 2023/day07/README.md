# --- Day 7: Camel Cards ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in JavaScript, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

basically a lot of character comparison (and substitution for part 2), and a lot of array sorting with special rules.

To run the solution, you'll need a javascript interpreter. I used Node.js v21.2.0

```zsh
node day07.js puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```zsh
Part one:
Total gains: 6440
The function "answerPartOne" took 2ms to run

Part two:
Total gains: 5905
The function "answerPartTwo" took 2ms to run
```
