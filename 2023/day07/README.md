# --- Day 7: \<name of challenge\> ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in JavaScript, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you'll need a javascript interpreter. I used Node.js v21.2.0

```zsh
node day07.js puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```zsh

```
