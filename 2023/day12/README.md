# --- Day 12: Hot Springs ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in JavaScript, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

I did part one with brute-force, but this was not possible for part two. I couldn't really find a way to do it, so I looked at the AoC subreddit for some help and inspiration.  
I'll maybe revisit this challenge later to try to solve it without help, or at least to better understand the recursive function

To run the solution, you'll need a javascript interpreter. I used Node.js v21.2.0

```zsh
node day12.js puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```zsh
Part one:
21
The function "answerPartOne" took 7ms to run

Part two:
525152
The function "answerPartTwo" took 5ms to run
```
