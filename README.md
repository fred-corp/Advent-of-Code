# Frédéric Druppel's take on Advent of Code

This repo contains my attempts at solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## 2022

2022 was the first year I heard of and participated in the Advent of Code. I chose to code my solutions in Python.  
Sometimes the solutions are clean, sometimes they are janky ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## 2023

In 2023 I'm choosing to code my solutions in JavaScript. Let's see how that goes !
