# --- Day 5: Supply Stacks ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 cranes.py puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part one:

"moveStacks9000" took 1.800 ms to execute
Top items after moves:
CMZ

Part two:

"moveStacks9001" took 0.999 ms to execute
Top items after moves:
MCD
```
