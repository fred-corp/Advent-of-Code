# --- Day 7: No Space Left On Device ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

> **Note:** I may have taken some inspiration from other solutions on the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zesk40/2022_day_7_solutions/) as I was stuck (my code worked for the example but not for the input, I had recursion errors, you know, fun stuff).

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 fileSystem.py puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part one :

"sumUnder" took 1.112 ms to execute
95437

Part two :

"findSmallestToDelete" took 1.696 ms to execute
24933642
```
