# --- Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 strategy.py puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part one :

"countScore" took 4.305 ms to execute
The score is 15

Part two :

"countScore2" took 1.182 ms to execute
The score is 12
```
