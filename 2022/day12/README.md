# --- Day 12: Hill Climbing Algorithm ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

> **Note:** I may have taken some inspiration from other solutions on the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zjnruc/2022_day_12_solutions/) as I was stuck in infinite loops and/or my answer wouldn't be right, even though I thought I had the right logic. Maybe I'll have to revisit this challenge later, or try it in a different language.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 wayFinder.py puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part One: 

"partOne" took 0.780 ms to execute
31

Part Two: 

"partTwo" took 404.982 ms to execute
29
```
