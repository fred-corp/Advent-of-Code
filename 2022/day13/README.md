# --- Day 13: Distress Signal ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 signalSorter.py puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part One :

"sumSortedGroupIndexes" took 24.730 ms to execute
13

Part Two :

"findDividerIndexProduct" took 28.656 ms to execute
140
```
