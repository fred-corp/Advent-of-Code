# --- Day 1: Calorie Counting ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 calorieCounter.py puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh

"findLargestGroup" took 1.471 ms to execute
The largest sum is README.md in group 4

"sum3LargestGroups" took 0.848 ms to execute
The sum of the 3 largest groups is 45000 (24000 + 11000 + 10000)
```
