# --- Day 9: Rope Bridge ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 ropePhysics.py puzzleInputTest2.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part one :

"countTailPositions" took 1.984 ms to execute
88

Part two :

"countArbitraryTailPositions" took 10.619 ms to execute
36
```
