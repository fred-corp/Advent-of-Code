# --- Day 20: Grove Positioning System ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 decrypt.py puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part one:

"partOne" took 88.193 ms to execute
3

Part two:

"partTwo" took 707.220 ms to execute
1623178306
```
