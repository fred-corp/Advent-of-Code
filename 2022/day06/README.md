# --- Day 6: Tuning Trouble ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 datastreamProcessor.py puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part one :

"findFirstTimeMarker" took 0.837 ms to execute
7

Part two :

"findFirstMessageMarker" took 1.764 ms to execute
19
```
