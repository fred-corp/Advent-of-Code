# --- Day 11: Monkey in the Middle ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 monkeyBusiness.py puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part One: 

"partOne" took 0.780 ms to execute
10605

Part Two: 

"partTwo" took 404.982 ms to execute
2713310158
```
