# --- Day 18: Boiling Boulders ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 cubes.py puzzleInputTest.txt 
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part One:

"countCubeFaces" took 7.752 ms to execute
64

Part Two:

"countVisibleCubeFaces" took 90.923 ms to execute
58
```
