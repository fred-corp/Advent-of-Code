# --- Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 reorganization.py puzzleInputTest.txt 
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part one :

"calculatePrioritySum" took 1.007 ms to execute
Sum of priorities is : 157

Part two :

"calculateGroupPrioritySum" took 0.837 ms to execute
Sum of group priorities is : 70
```
