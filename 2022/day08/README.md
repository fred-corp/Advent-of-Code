# --- Day 8: Treetop Tree House ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 forester.py puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part one : 

"countVisibleTrees" took 2.105 ms to execute
21

Part two : 

"getHighestScenicScore" took 1.676 ms to execute
8
```
