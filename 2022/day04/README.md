# --- Day 4: Camp Cleanup ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 cleanup.py puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part one :

"calculateValidPairs" took 1.785 ms to execute
2

Part two :

"calculateOverlapPairs" took 1.642 ms to execute
4
```
