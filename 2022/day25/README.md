# --- Day 25: Full of Hot Air ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 proprietaryNumbers.py puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part One:

"sumSNAFU" took 1.122 ms to execute
2=-1=0
```
