# --- Day 14: Regolith Reservoir ---

## Solution

The challenge was done in Python, with a timer decorator to measure the execution time.

To run the solution, you need a working installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Then, run the following command from this directory:

```sh
python3 sandFlowMechanics.py puzzleInputTest.txt
```

The output (with the specified dataset) should be:

```sh
Part one:

"calcStaticSandParticles" took 16.277 ms to execute
24

Part two:

"calcStaticSandParticles" took 451.917 ms to execute
93
```
